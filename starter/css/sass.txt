Lecture 23:

Sass is a CSS preprocessor, an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language.
Fixes the messiness of having a single CSS file. Breaks thousands of lines of code into small reusable chunks

Features:
-Variables: reusable values such as colors, font-sizes, spacing
-Nesting: nest selectors inside of one another
-Operators
-Partials and imports: Importing CSS files into one file
-Mixins: To write reusable pieces of CSS code
-Functions: produce a value that can be used, similar to mixins except for first part
-Extends: Different selectos inherit declarations that are common to all of them
-Control directives: Conditionals and loops
